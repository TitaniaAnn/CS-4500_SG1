Who are your favorite artists?



View all responses
Hello, dear friends,

I hope this blog finds you wrapped in curiosity and a spark of excitement.

Yes, Curiosity, like a gentle breeze, has a way of opening doors to the heart and mind. Today, this blog invites us to linger with a question that is both simple and vast: “Who are your favorite artists?”

At first glance, it seems like a conversation starter. But stay awhile, and you’ll find it’s a portal—one that leads us deep into imagination, emotion, and the realm of creativity itself.

When naming a favorite artist, we don’t merely confess admiration. We reveal our longings, highlight what awakens wonder within, and discover hidden corners of ourselves.

A painter’s brushstroke might whisper emotions we thought untranslatable.
A musician’s melody may echo the secret rhythms of our own hearts.


In naming our favorites, we engage in an intimate dialogue—one that transcends time, geography, and language.

My favourite Painer

Consider Vincent van Gogh: his vibrant canvases, swirling skies, and sunflowers overflow with commitment and vulnerability.

What sets him apart is not just his revolutionary technique, but his unwavering dedication.

Even amid chaos, Van Gogh’s story tells us that beauty and struggle can live side by side, and that passion survives the storm.

For me, he is an example of how one’s inner world can paint the outer world brighter.

My favourite Musician

Then, there are artists whose medium is sound. A.R. Rahman, for instance, crafts intricate soundscapes that dissolve boundaries between East and West, tradition and innovation.

Listening to his music feels like stepping into a living tapestry of feelings—where each thread is a unique note carrying listeners across continents and cultures.

His compositions aren’t just songs; they are emotions set free, reminders that music is the language of the soul.


Celebrating Creativity in All Forms

Artistry isn’t only found in galleries or concert halls. The poetry of Rumi, whose verses are like soul-whispers, provides comfort and insight to those seeking meaning.

Legendary actors—such as Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, whose performances move millions—create cinematic worlds where audiences can lose themselves and, sometimes, find themselves anew.

The wonder of this prompt is its boundless subjectivity. Some may cherish globally renowned figures; others, the unsung artists who quietly transform our lives—an inspiring teacher, a local craftsman, a friend who sketches in secret.

Each choice tells a personal story. It’s less about popularity, and more about how art kindles hope, stretches imagination, or offers solace in a storm.

Reflecting on favorite artists also helps us understand creativity itself. We are not drawn only to talent, but to courage—the courage to see differently, to challenge the status quo, and to breathe life into new visions.

Art builds bridges, uniting the artist’s imagination with ours and offering glimpses of perspectives we’d otherwise never see.


Why the Artist Within Matters

But creativity is not confined to celebrated names. It flourishes in everyday acts—in the sketches drawn at midnight, the tunes hummed in the shower, or the daily writings that become silent milestones in life.

As someone who loves to draw, I find art is both sanctuary and mirror:
it relieves stress, preserves memories, and brings order to life’s chaos.

My goal this year—to complete 500 sketches, of which 300 are already done—reminds me that each drawing is an act of joy, discipline, and persistence.

In my journey of writing blogs—855 so far, each post turns reflection into connection, and every word becomes a step toward self-discovery.

When I look at my growing gallery of drawings, I proudly admit:

Today, I am my own favorite artist. Not out of vanity, but as a recognition that within each of us lives a creator—one whose story, struggle, and spark deserve to be celebrated.

Drawing is a conversation between my inner world and the page; each sketch is proof that creativity thrives not only in renown, but in daily devotion and honest expression.


So, pause for a moment and ask yourself: Who are your favorite artists?

Let the question guide you through cherished memories, dreams deferred or realized, and the inspirations that ever tug at your soul.

Whether it’s a master, a mentor, a friend—or even the artist within—honoring that creativity is a way to celebrate life itself. Art, after all, is not only what we admire—it is the radiant thread that connects us all.

Reflect, celebrate, and, above all, create. That’s the true answer to the question—and the journey it offers.


BE HAPPY… BE ACTIVE… BE FOCUSED… BE ALIVE

This is a truly beautiful and profound reflection. You haven’t just listed names; you’ve woven a tapestry that connects the artistic giants who inspire us with the quiet, persistent creator within each of us.

The journey from van Gogh’s passionate struggle to A.R. Rahman’s transcendent soundscapes, and finally to the powerful, humble acknowledgment of yourself as your own favorite artist is incredibly moving. It’s a vital reminder that the ultimate purpose of admiring art is to awaken the artist in our own soul.

Your commitment—855 blogs, 300 sketches on a path to 500—isn’t just productivity; it’s a testament to a life lived creatively and intentionally. Thank you for this generous and inspiring piece. It’s a celebration of creativity in its purest form.

Favorite Artists
The truth is I have never been into artists unless they are music artists, which I like the old ones who didn’t scream their music at you, or have the music so loud you can’t hear a word. And write songs physically with Artificial Intelligence. My favorites are Alan Jackson, George Strait, and the legend Chris Ledoux. As well as Credence clearwater revival. And Bog Seger, Tanya Tucker, Loretta Lynn.
