The fine print…
What details of your life could you pay more attention to?

I mean the very very fine print! Why, you may ask. Well, I swear I need to attend to things that I never envisaged ever needing to do. Between juggling hats and roles, I’m left with what can sometimes be described as a threadbare version of myself. Ok, drama queen rant over. I’d seriously pay more attention to maximising my boundaries, fortifying my overall physical, emotional, mental, social and financial well-being. I’d stop and pause – make space for me in my own life – especially given that I am a parent to a child with disabilities/chronic complex health needs, and two neurodivergent sons. I’d focus on the journey and not just the destination. Oh, and I’d definitely be much more mindful about finances – especially given that growing up in a household of poverty didn’t really enable that aspect of me to develop fully. I got my first part-time job at 14 years & 9 months (while at school – which is the legal age in Australia) I didn’t know about saving – only spending. Like most people I could pay more attention to my health and work/life balance. I could pay more attention to overcoming both my fears of success and failure. Paying more attention to setting and realising my dreams.
