Searching for Myself

A person takes a picture of their shadow.
What details of your life could you pay more attention to?

When I was younger, I tried to learn juggling. It was a total non starter due to my dyspraxia and my general lack of fine motor skills and coordination! Once I had three items to juggle it all just fell apart, and to be honest ‘juggling’ two items was often a stretch! The same is true of my approach to life.

When you think about it, in its simplest form, life has three components, Work, family life and personal needs. From 18 to 22 I only needed to concentrate on two things, work and personal. When Janet and I moved in together the focus shifted to home and personal, because I was studying at Polytechnic and then Teacher Training college, although the personal was now just as focused on what she needed. However, when I had to start juggling, it made perfect sense for work and family to take the lead as we had young children, were often abroad in unfamiliar and stressful environments and very much flying by the seat of our pants.

Work and family, quite rightly, became my complete focus for 30 years or so. When I stepped back from full time work at the beginning of this month I found that I wasn’t really sure who I was as an individual or what I need to thrive. I have loads of ideas but none have coalesced as yet. Not really surprising of course, as I haven’t lived on my own since 1990. I remember the, perhaps apocryphal, story about Jon Pertwee, my Doctor Who as a child and still my favourite, who was advised to play the character as Jon Pertwee. His reply was ‘Who the hell’s that?’ and I can totally understand what he meant!!

So, the area of my life that needs the most attention is me. I need to find out who I am, without work but with time to fill. Once I get the answer to that I will know what to do next. I will be reflecting on this at greater length in another post this weekend as I review my first month post full-time work. Wish me luck!

I’ve had that kind of soul searching, “Who am i? Where is my life going?” thing the last 5 years, since Covid in fact. Am i just a man who is married, works in a supermarket and loves music? Is that it? And is it enough? I’m a Mod, but not an “active” one – i rarely go to events or gigs, and i don’t always dress the part. Money, time and health issues have variously got in the way. I’m still searching for the real me.

Well, keep searching. Even if you don’t get the full answer, every discovery will get you nearer and make you feel better.

I suppose this question goes back to the post on positive emotion. You are motivated by what makes you feel good. I like the sense of pride I have when I do something for some and it helps them. I like the sense of pride I get from achieving something in whatever field that might be. However, one thing motivates me above all else and that is my family. Everything I do, everything I am, is for them and because of them. I remember when I first met my wife back in 1987. I was aimless and lost. Yes, I had potential, but it was being wasted. She saw that and slowly but surely gave me a new focus and a new determination. It was a slow process but it was, and remains, an ongoing one. When we were about to leave to go to Hong Kong the Mother of a friend of mine came to our farewell drinks because she wanted to meet the woman who had sorted me out!! She wasn’t wrong! Since becoming a Father I have had another focus and another motivation. Providing for them, of course, but much more importantly, trying to be a good role model for them as a person. As with all of us, I fall extremely short on most occasions because human beings are generally speaking unsuccessful at being their best selves. However I am always trying.
Reflecting on Silence
The first post I wrote for this blog when I restarted it was about an extended period of deafness that arose due to a combination of hearing issues in my left ear and the complete blocking of my right ear due to wax build up. During that time I was working online so I was able to teach with the use of headphones, but otherwise I was pretty much trapped in a world of very muffled sound. There was some ability to hear, but it needed to be carefully managed and it was only for conversation. Music was lost to me for six months because I couldn’t pick up a tune. That time was extremely difficult for me because music had been part of my life for about 50 years by then, and it was the very basis of my online persona at that point. Without it I had less to say and it definitely isolated me from people in both spheres of my life. Looking back, it took almost all of the colour out of my existence and the loss of music was a huge part of that. Even today, I look back and shudder when I think how grey and dispiriting that time was. I genuinely can’t understand people who rarely listen to music because to me it’s as central to my life as breathing. Do they feel grey and dispirited? What would happen if I became deaf again? Perhaps I could deal with it a bit better but I know it would remove a huge part of my life, a part that is irreplaceable.
